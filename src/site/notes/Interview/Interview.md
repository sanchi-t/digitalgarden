Look at the [[Interview/Interview Prep\|Interview Prep]] for generic preparation but you should always be prepared with company specific questions and details for example "Why do you want to join this company?", "What do you want to learn from this role?", "Are you aware about the company's work?", "What values you can add to this company?" 

Look at the following interview guides:
- [[Interview/Backend/Backend Role\|Backend Role]]
- [[Interview/Backend/NodeJs\|NodeJs]]
- [[Interview/Backend/Database\|Database]]
