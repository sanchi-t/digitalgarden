### What went wrong:
The interviewer was stuck at how does recommendation system works in Learnify. If two courses have same cosine similarity how do we decide  which course to pick. How do we deal with overrated courses on udemy as anyone can rate them while websites like coursera have courses which are created by credible organisations and ratings might not do justice to those course. The interviewer was not satisfied with my explanation and with how the recommendation system works.
