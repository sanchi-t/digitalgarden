### What went wrong:
I struggled to answer several technical questions, including those related to the JavaScript event loop, caching, imports/exports, and more. Additionally, I stammered more than I would have liked and often took long pauses. My explanations could have been more thorough and well-structured. At times, I started a sentence but found it difficult to finish it, leading to a lack of clarity and conciseness in my responses.
